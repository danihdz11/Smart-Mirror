## 🚀 How It Works
1. User stands in front of the mirror.  
2. Camera + Raspberry Pi perform facial recognition.  
3. Identified user’s data (habits, calendar, reminders) is displayed on the mirror screen.  
4. NodeMCU and sensors provide additional IoT inputs (e.g., temperature, presence).  
5. Data is logged and can be visualized or managed remotely.
